                        <p>Drought is a natural disaster that occurs when a region experiences a prolonged period of time without sufficient rainfall or water supply. Droughts have been affecting the world for centuries, but the impact of climate change has made them more frequent, intense, and widespread. The changing climate has led to shifts in precipitation patterns, reduced soil moisture, and increased evaporation rates, making droughts a global concern.</p>
                        <p>The effects of drought are diverse and can cause significant environmental, social, and economic problems. One of the most immediate consequences of drought is crop failure, which can result in food shortages, higher prices, and increased competition for resources. This can lead to social unrest and political instability, particularly in developing countries where agriculture is a primary source of income.</p>
                        <p>Droughts also lead to changes in the ecosystems, including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and desertification. The reduced water availability also affects wildlife and their habitats, making it harder for them to survive. In addition to that, drought can have a profound impact on the water supply for human consumption, which can exacerbate the existing water scarcity in some areas. This leads to competition between different sectors such as agriculture, industry, and households for the limited water resources available.</p>
                        <p>Droughts are a major concern for the world, and its effects are far-reaching. Climate change has made droughts more frequent and intense, leading to significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. It is crucial to take proactive measures to reduce the effects of drought, including conservation and efficient use of water resources, land management practices, and climate change mitigation efforts. Only through collective action, can we hope to mitigate the impact of drought and build a more sustainable future."</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Second heading</h2>
                        <p>You can include calls to action or organize your information with subheadings like so. Just be sure you adjust the title of these headings if you use them.</p>
                        <p>This means your headings should not say second heading.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">You may copy or replace this code if you want to quote someone. Four lines of quotation or more (on the page) should be in block quotes, which is why these containers are called block quotes. Not creative but effective.</blockquote>
                        <p>Remember to always unpack a block quote. You should leave the reader remembering your voice, not someone else's.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Third heading</h2>
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a pdf or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/handstoheart.jpeg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
