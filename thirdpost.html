                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is a drought?</h2>
                        <p>Drought is a natural disaster that occurs when a region experiences a prolonged period of time without sufficient rainfall or water supply. Droughts have been affecting the world for centuries, but the impact of climate change has made them more frequent, intense, and widespread. The changing climate has led to shifts in precipitation patterns, reduced soil moisture, and increased evaporation rates, making droughts a global concern.</p>
                        <p>The effects of drought are diverse and can cause significant environmental, social, and economic problems. One of the most immediate consequences of drought is crop failure, which can result in food shortages, higher prices, and increased competition for resources. This can lead to social unrest and political instability, particularly in developing countries where agriculture is a primary source of income.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why should we care?</h2>
                        <p>Droughts also lead to changes in the ecosystems, including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and desertification. The reduced water availability also affects wildlife and their habitats, making it harder for them to survive. In addition to that, drought can have a profound impact on the water supply for human consumption, which can exacerbate the existing water scarcity in some areas. This leads to competition between different sectors such as agriculture, industry, and households for the limited water resources available.</p>
                        <p>Droughts are a major concern for the world, and its effects are far-reaching. Climate change has made droughts more frequent and intense, leading to significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. It is crucial to take proactive measures to reduce the effects of drought, including conservation and efficient use of water resources, land management practices, and climate change mitigation efforts. Only through collective action, can we hope to mitigate the impact of drought and build a more sustainable future."</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What droughts look like</h2>
                        <p>This picture was taken from a desert in California, as nothing is growing due to this extreme drought. Throughout the last few years, California has been one of the driest states in the USA. Many droughts and wildfires have happened due to this inclement weather.</p>
